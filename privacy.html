    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>SEF Boletins de Alojamento</strong> ("the Add-on") handles your information when you use it in conjunction with Google Sheets. By using the Add-on, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>How the Add-on Works</h2>
        <p>The Add-on is designed to assist users in automating the process of sending <strong>Boletins de Alojamento</strong> via Webservice to SEF (Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras) based on data provided in their Google Sheets documents.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Runs automatically (daily or on-demand) as configured by the user.</li>
            <li>Processes data within the user’s Google Sheet to prepare and send the required information to SEF.</li>
            <li>Sends an email notification to the user in case an error occurs during processing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information We Access</h2>
        <p>The Add-on uses specific Google API scopes to perform its functions:</p>
        <h3>Non-Sensitive Scopes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access to your Google Drive files</strong>: The Add-on accesses only the specific Google Sheets document where it is installed to read and process the data required to send Boletins de Alojamento.</li>
            <li><strong>View your primary email address</strong>: The Add-on uses your email address to identify you as the user.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sensitive Scopes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Send email on your behalf</strong>: The Add-on sends emails to your email address only when an error occurs during processing. These emails include information about the error to assist in resolving the issue.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Handling</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Private Data is Received or Stored</strong>: The Add-on does not collect, store, or transmit private data to the Add-on owner or any third party.</li>
            <li><strong>On-the-Fly Processing</strong>: All processing is done locally within the user's Google Sheet and the SEF Webservice. The Add-on does not retain or manage any user data.</li>
            <li><strong>Email Notifications</strong>: Emails are sent only to the user’s primary Google Account email address in case of an error, ensuring no third-party data sharing occurs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>As the user, you are responsible for:</p>

            <li>Ensuring the accuracy of the data entered into the Google Sheet.</li>
            <li>Managing access permissions to the Google Sheet where the Add-on is installed.</li>
            <li>Complying with local regulations regarding the handling of Boletins de Alojamento.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>The Add-on leverages Google’s secure API environment, ensuring that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data transmission occurs over secure connections (HTTPS).</li>
            <li>Access to your Google Sheets and email is restricted to the specific permissions granted by you when installing the Add-on.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>
        <p>The Add-on does not share or sell your information to any third party. Data processed by the Add-on is sent directly to SEF's Webservice as configured by the user.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the Add-on’s functionality or applicable legal requirements. The latest version will always be available within the Add-on description or website.</p>
